# land-status
This Python program is designed to retrieve survey numbers based on the selection of district, mandal, and village from the Dharani Telangana website (https://dharani.telangana.gov.in/knowLandStatus).
The website provides information on land status in Telangana, allowing users to select specific districts, mandals, and villages to view corresponding survey numbers.

The program utilizes web scraping techniques with the Selenium library to automate the process of selecting dropdown options and extracting survey numbers. It enhances efficiency by eliminating the need for manual navigation through the website, providing a streamlined method for accessing land status information.
